# EventsMyPpl /Practicum Project
Version Demo
This branch is a demo frontend version. 

## About
This project is a social media get together application. It is set up around the idea of creating and hosting get togethers. This version of the project isn't going to be continued. 

## Technology
### Java & Spring Boot
I worked on this while in my practicum class. I focused on Java and Android Development during my time in school. As such I looked for a Java based backend and believed using Spring would make it faster to develop. I don't feel I had many problems with the backend and will be continuing work on the Spring Boot part of the application.

### JS, Vue & NPM 
For this project idea, I thought doing a web application made the most sense. I wanted to try to create a realistic web application despite not doing front end development. I didn't give myself enough time, but love learning and trying out new frameworks and tools. I tried out Vue JS (2) without much knowledge of modern Javascript. I'm glad for the experience and what I learned, but I've decided to look for a different front end solution. Using a framework required a lot of excess from NPM and I didn't expect the numerous problems with broken libraries, packages and such. 

The way the frontend and backend are managed is through Maven pom.xml. The basic project setup was borrowed from the one here: https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs. 

## Lessons
I learned about quite a few tools and pieces of a frontend framework while working on this project. One thing I really wanted to get out of this project was to get a clearer understanding of how the front end and back end interact and now have a complete (abstract) understanding of it. 

## Project Info
A folder has been added with Practicum class materials. 

## To Run

To run the front end: go into the frontend directory and run **npm run serve** like you'd run most JS frameworks. You'll need Node and Npm to do this. For this demo it is paired with JSON-Server demodb.json. this will need to be run at the same time as the Vue site with json-server demodb.json.
