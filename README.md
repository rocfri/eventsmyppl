# EventsMyPpl

Version 0.0 
Just created basic structure and setup up git for repo.

## About
This project is a social media get together application. It is set up around the idea of creating and hosting events.

## To Run
This is just a SpringBoot frame at the moment. You can download it and import it to a Java IDE as a Maven project and it'll come up on localhost:8080 when running.
