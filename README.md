# EventsMyPpl
Version Demo
This branch is a demo frontend version. The design may be merged, but won't change the API on main.

## About
This project is a social media get together application. It is set up around the idea of creating and hosting events.

The way the frontend and backend are managed is through Maven pom.xml. The basic project setup was borrowed from the one here: https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs. 

##Project Info
A folder has been added with Practicum class materials. 

## To Run

To run the front end: go into the frontend directory and run **npm run serve** like you'd run most JS frameworks. You'll need Node and Npm to do this. For this demo it is paired with JSON-Server demodb.json. this will need to be run at the same time as the Vue site with json-server demodb.json.
